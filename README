NAME
    Kvasir - General rule engine for analysis and stuff like that

SYNOPSIS
      use Kvasir::Declare;
  
      my $engine = engine {
          prehook "has_more_email" => instanceof "MyApp::HasMoreEmails";
      
          # Returns an Email::Simple instance
          input "email" => instanceof "MyApp::GetEmail";
      
          input "from" => does {
                my $input = $_[KV_INPUT];
                return $input->get("email")->header("From");
          };
      
          rule "is_spam" => instanceof "MyApp::SpamDetector";
      
          rule "is_from_boss" => does {
              my $input = $_[KV_INPUT];
          
              if ($input->get("from") =~ /theboss@company\.com/) {
                  return KV_MATCH;
              }
          
              return KV_NO_MATCH;
          }
      
          action "mark_for_deletion" => does {
              my $local = $_[KV_LOCAL];
              $local->set("delete-email" => 1);
          };
      
          trigger "mark_for_deletion"" => when qw(is_spam is_from_boss);
      
          post_hook "process_mail" => does {
              my ($input, $local) = @_[KV_INPUT, KV_LOCAL];
          
              if ($local->get("delete-mail") == 1) {
                  MyApp::EmailHandler->delete($input->get("email"));
              }
          
              return KV_CONTINUE;
          };
      };
  
      $engine->run();

DESCRIPTION
    Kvasir is a generic rule based processing engine. Processing is done
    while neither any pre nor post iteration hook aborts processing. Each
    engine supports multiple pre- and posthooks, inputs, output, actions and
    rules. An action is attached to one or several rules and is executed if
    any of the rules matches. Input is processed when needed and only once
    per iteration.

    Multiple engines can be run in parallel in a runloop. Runloops can be
    ran until no more data is available for processing or by a single step
    at a time. This way multiple runloops may be executed simultaneously.

USAGE
    Kvasir has a declarative interface via Kvasir::Declare which is the
    simplest way to define engines. The synopsis shows an exmaple that could
    be implemented (with reservations for syntax errors).

  Declarative interface
    Kvasir::Declare

  Runloops
    Runloops transforms engines into something executable and runs them.

    Kvasir::Runloop

  Inputs, Outputs, Rules, Hooks, Actions
    The components that makes up an engine.

    Kvasir::Input, Kvasir::Output, Kvasir::Rule, Kvasir::Hook,
    Kvasir::Action
